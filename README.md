Lambda handler example ? 
```
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    create_and_write(
        file_name="abc",
        object_to_parquet={"test": "value"},
        send_to_s3=True,
        s3_bucket="s3_parquet_bucket",

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    create_and_write(
        file_name="local_parquet",
        object_to_parquet={"test": "value"}     
    )
```

Why not boto3 library? <br/>
AWS Lambda server already has boto3 inside.

Why <b>fastparquet</b> and not <b>pyarrow</b>? <br/>
Pyarrow library is too large. Did not find any way to import from s3 ...
